gcc-wrapper is a small shell script that invokes gcc with specified
arguments, sending stdout to stdout and stderr to stderr, and returning
gcc's exit status.  It's intended to act just like gcc itself, except
that it filters out a specific warning message generated by gcc 3.2.

The message in question is:

cc1: warning: changing search order for system directory "/usr/local/include"
cc1: warning:   as it has already been specified as a non-system directory

This has caused problems for software packages built using GNU
autoconf.  The problem is that the "configure" script sees this
(actually harmless) warning message and assumes that the compilation
failed.

The warning message was introduced in gcc 3.2, and was removed in
gcc 3.2.1.  If you don't have gcc 3.2, you don't need gcc-wrapper
(unless you want to adapt it to filter out some other warning message).
The Red Hat 8 and SuSE 8.1 Linux distributions include gcc 3.2 by
default; other distributions may do so as well.

More details are at <http://www.sdsc.edu/~kst/gcc-3.2-bug>.
One package affected by this is Globus; see
<http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=488>.

This gcc-wrapper script is a quick and dirty workaround.  The best
solution is to upgrade your gcc and/or your operating system (for
example, Red Hat 9 includes gcc 3.2.2, which doesn't produce the
warning).
