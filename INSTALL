To install gcc-wrapper, run the "install-gcc-wrapper" script.
Run "install-gcc-wrapper -help" to print a help message.

Once you've installed it, you need to add the bin directory to your
$PATH in front of the directory containing the actual gcc.

Now the "gcc" command  will invoke the gcc-wrapper script, which will
in turn invoke your system's gcc command via the "gcc.real" symlink.
