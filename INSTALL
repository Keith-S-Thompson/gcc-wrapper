Installation instructions for gcc-wrapper

There is no installation script for gcc-wrapper (yet); to install it,
you'll need to copy the files manually.

1.  Create an installation directory (I'll call it DIR).

2.  Copy the gcc-wrapper script to DIR/gcc-wrapper
    Adjust the "#!" line (line 1) if your Perl is not /usr/bin/perl

3.  cd DIR

4.  ln -s gcc-wrapper gcc

4a. ln -s gcc-wrapper cc
    # Do this only if "cc" is a symbolic link to "gcc".

5.  ln -s /usr/bin/gcc gcc.real
    # Adjust "/usr/bin/gcc" to the location where your gcc is actually
    # installed.  This is so gcc-wrapper (invoked as "gcc") can
    # find the real gcc (invoked by gcc-wrapper as "gcc.real").

5a. ln -s /usr/bin/cc gcc.real
    # Do this only if "cc" is a symbolic link to "gcc", as it commonly
    # is on Linux systems.

6.  Add DIR to your $PATH in front of the directory containing the
    actual gcc.

Now the "gcc" command (and the "cc" command, if you've followed steps
4a and 5a) will invoke the gcc-wrapper script, which will in turn
invoke your system's gcc command via the "gcc.real" symlink.
